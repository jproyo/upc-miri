Lets probe with y = -b 

============
x = 1 y = -b
-a-bx-y + -ab-y + -abx  + a-b-xy + a-bx-y + a-bxy + ab-xy

v -1 -2 -3 -4 0 => Therefore y = -b and we have y = -b = -4 ==> b

============
x = a y = -b

v -1 -2 -3 -4 0 => Therefore x = a and we have x = a = -3 ==> -a 

Therefore -a + b 

Putting first deduction and second togheter we have -a + b /\ a + -b ==> a <=> b
