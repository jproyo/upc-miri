\section{Problem 10}
\subsection{Question a}
\subsubsection{Monotone}
In order to probe if this game is \textit{monotone} we need to probe that $v(C) \leq v(D)$ for any $C,D$ such that $C \subseteq D$.
Since we have a case function we are going to analyze the different parts. 

Let have a graph $G_x = (V, X)$. Since by definition the players are the Edges, we can add player to $X$, so we are adding edges $Y$ to the graph $G_x$, such that
$X' = X \cup Y$. Lets call this new graph $G_x' = (V', X')$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $G_x'$ is connected then $v(X') = 2|X'| - \text{diam}(G_x')$. Since we are adding more edges $|X'| > |X|$, and the diameter is at least greater or equal $diam(G_x') \geq diam(G_x)$ because it is connected and by definition of diameter if we are adding edges the greatest length of the shortest path cannot be smaller with more edges.
  \item If $G_x'$ is not connected also $\frac{|X'|}{2} > \frac{|X|}{2}$.
\end{itemize}

Therefore for any $G_x \subseteq G_x'$, $v(X) \leq v(X')$, so it is \textbf{Monotone}.

\subsubsection{Superadditive}
A game is Superadditive if $v(C \cup D) \geq v(C) + v(D)$ for any 2 disjoint coalitions $C$ and $D$.

Lets analyize each case. 
Lets take if $G_{X \cup Y}$ is connected, then 

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    v(X \cup Y) &= 2(|X| + |Y|) - diam(G_{X \cup Y})\\
                &= 2|X| + 2|Y| - diam(G_{X \cup Y})
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

And $2|X| + 2|Y| - diam(G_{X \cup Y}) \geq 2|X| - diam(G_X) + 2|Y| - diam(G_Y)$ because $diam(G_{X \cup Y}) \leq diam(G_X) + diam(G_Y)$ since it is included in one of the 2.

Lets take if $G_{X \cup Y}$ is not connected, then 

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    v(X \cup Y) &= \frac{|X| + |Y|}{2}\\
                &= \frac{|X|}{2} + \frac{|Y|}{2}\\
                &= v(X) + v(Y)
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Therefore it is superadditive.

\subsubsection{Supermodular}
A game is Supermodular if $v(C \cup D) + v(C \cap D) \geq v(C) + v(D)$.

By the previous item we have probe that it is superadditive, so if we sum $v(C \cap D)$ to the union, we are still going to have something
greater or equal of the sum of the individual valuation functions, therefore it is also supermodular.

\subsection{Question b}
Yes, a graph of only 1 edge because. Let suppose that that graph is $A = (Z, Y)$ where $Z={z,v}$ and $Y = {z,v}$. 
Lets assume that we take $X = Y$, then

\begin{itemize}
  \item $v(X) = 2 |X| - diam(A_X) = 2 \times 1 - 1 = 1$ 
  \item Also we have that $x(X) = 1$ because we have 1 edge.
  \item Therefore the core is not empty.
\end{itemize}
