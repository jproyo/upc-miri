\section{Exercise 1}
A \acrfull{ncg} is \textbf{symmetric} when $s_i = s$ and $t_i = t$, for $i \in N$ according to the definition that we have seen in class. Basically all the players, have the 
same source and destination endpoint $s$ and $t$ and all have the same path strategies.

The algorithm to find \acrfull{pne} in \acrshort{sncg} in \textit{poly-time} is doing a reduction to \acrfull{mincost}
in order to find the Optimum of $\varphi(s)$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}
  \SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}
  \Input{$G = (V, E, s, t)$, $d_e$ delay function}
  \Output{\acrshort{mincost} representation of the problem}
  \For{each $e \in E$}{
    \For{$1$ up to $d_e$}{
      $E \leftarrow E \cup \{e'_i\}$ such that $d_{e'_i} = 1$;\\
    }
    $E \leftarrow E \setminus \{e\}$;\\
  }
  return $N$;
  \caption{Compute \acrshort{mincost} reduction of \acrshort{sncg}}
\end{algorithm}

Basically the reduction is replacing each edge $e$ with the amount of the delay function for $e$ $d_e$ of new edges
but this time each of this edges with delay function equal to $1$.

The \acrshort{mincost} of the new network $N$ minimizes $\varphi(s)$.

Since the algorithm is giving also a Local Optimum, then $s$ is a \acrshort{pne}.

\section{Exercise 2}
As we have seen in class the \textbf{Social Cost} is the sum of all players 

\begin{equation}
  C(s) = \sum_{u \in V} c_u(s) = \alpha|E| + \sum_{u,v \in V} d_G(u,v)
\end{equation}

Every pair of vertices that is not \textit{connected} its distances is $\ge 2$, there is a lower bound for the 
social cost:

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    C(s) &\geq \alpha|E| + 2|E| + 2(n(n - 1) - 2|E|)\\
         &= 2n(n - 1) + (\alpha - 2)|E|\label{eq:1}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{(a)}
In this case when $\alpha < 1$ the social Optimum is achieved when $|E|$ is maximum. So, every vertex is connected with each other. It is a complete graph.
Any \acrfull{ne} should be of diameter $1$ which implies that the complete graph is the only \acrshort{ne}.

\subsection{(b)}
In the case $1 \leq \alpha < 2$, the social Optimum is achieved by a complete graph, but not \acrshort{ne}. Any \acrshort{ne} is for diameter at most $2$.
So, the social cost is equal to~\ref{eq:1} and it is the worst cost when $|E|$ is minimum, which is $n-1$ for a connected graph. Therefore the worst \acrshort{ne} is the $S_n$ Star.

\subsection{(c)}
As we have seen in class when $\alpha > 2$ we need to minimize the number of edges $|E|$ in order to reduce the cost, but at the same time the graph should be connected.
Therefore only trees with diameter $2$ have optimal cost. One example that has \acrshort{ne}, with diameter $2$ and minimum number of edges is a \textbf{Cycle Graph} with 4 vertex.

\subsection{(d)}
Since when $\alpha > n^2$ no player has any incentive to buy an edge, there is going to be the minimum amount possible of edges at the same time with the graph connected, 
that by definition are \textbf{Spanning Trees} as we have seen in class. All are \acrshort{ne} because no one has incentive to change.
The $PoA$ is giving by:

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    PoA &= \frac{c(T_n)}{c(S_n)}\\
        &\leq \frac{\alpha(n-1)+(n-1)(n-1)}{\alpha(n-1)+1+2n(n-1)}\\ 
        & = O(1)
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\section{Exercise 3}
\subsection{(a)}
In order to show that it is a \acrfull{sg}, we need to show that the valuation function is \textbf{monotone}.

We assume in this game that

\[ v(X) = \begin{cases}
  1 \textit{ if X is a dominant set of G}\\
  0 \textit{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

And on the other hand we know that A Game is monotone if $v(C) \leq v(D)$ for any $C, D$ such that $C \subseteq D$.

Lets take any $C,D \in G$ such that $C \subseteq D$ and lets consider the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $D$ is a dominant set, any subset of vertices on $D$, lets call $C$ such that $C \subseteq D$, have 2 possibilities: either
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $C$ is also dominant because we remove some border vertex which adjacency vertices are connected to other $v \in C$, so $v(C) = v(D) = 1$
    \item $C$ is not dominant because selected subset is not a resulting dominant set, in which case $v(C) = 0 < v(D)$
  \end{itemize}
  \item If $D$ is non dominant then any subset is also non dominant so $v(C) = v(D) = 0$.
\end{itemize}

Then we can conclude that $v(C) \leq v(D)$, for any $C, D \in G, C \subseteq D$. So this is \textbf{monotone}.

Therefore it is a \acrshort{sg}.

\subsection{(b)}
Base on the theorem that states \textit{A simple game has non-empty core if and only if it has a veto player}, we can check
if there is a veto player for some \textit{dominant game} in order to see if it has a non-empty core.
An example of that is a $S_n$ star in which the center vertex $c$ belongs to any coalition that contains $c$ but it cannot be remove from any of those 
coalition because if we remove it it is not a \textit{dominant set}.
