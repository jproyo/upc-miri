\section{Problem 15}
\newtheorem*{congest}{Singleton Congestion Game}

\begin{congest}
In singleton congestion games with $n$ players accessing to a set of $m$ resources, all best response sequences have length at most $n^2m$
\end{congest}
\begin{proof}
Having the set of delay functions $V = \{d(e, f(k, e)) | e \in E \land 1 \leq k \leq n \}$, we sort this set in increasing order
and we define a new delay function such as each value is the index of the ordered previous set $V$.

\begin{equation*}
  d'(e, f(k,e)) = \text{index of } d(e, f(k, e)) \text{ of sorted set } V
\end{equation*}


Having this, it is trivial to observed that if some the strategy selected $(s_{-i}, s'_i)$ for some player $i$, reduce the cost in $d'_e(k)$ also it is reduced on $d_e(k)$.
As we are analyzing for a Singleton Congestion game we know that $s_{-i} = {r}$ and $s'_i = {r'}$ by definition, therefore $c(s_{-i}) = d(r,f(s_{-i}, r))$ and $c(s'_i) = d(r',f(s'_i, r'))$.
Since for player $i$, $(s_{-i}, s'_i)$ is an improvement, we know that $d(r', f(s'_i, r')) < d(r, f(s_{-i}, r))$, and also $d'(r', f(s'_i, r')) < d'(r, f(s_{-i}, r))$.

We also observe that $d'(e, f(k,e)) \leq nm, \forall\ e \in E, k \in N$, since $|V| \leq nm$.

Taking \textbf{Rossenthal's} potential function delay can be upper bound as:

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \Phi(s) = \sum_{e \in E} \sum_{k = 1}^{f(s,e)} d'(e,f(k,e)) \leq \sum_{e \in E} \sum_{k = 1}^{f(s,e)} nm \leq n^2m
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

$n^2$ is taking because every player uses exactly one resource, therefore $\sum_{e \in E} f(k,e) = n$.
\end{proof}

\section{Problem 17}
It can be seen that $PoA = PoS = \frac{k}{k} = 1$ and this is because of the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to maximize their utility each player is going to perform the task until $k$ select as strategy perform the task. 
  \item As we have analyzed this problem before there is a $NE \iff \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \neq k-1$, this indicates that $PoA = \frac{k}{k}$, because when reaching the equilibrium non player has incentive to change its strategy.
  \item The same happen with $PoS = \frac{k}{k}$
  \item Therefore it is a stabilized game
\end{itemize}
